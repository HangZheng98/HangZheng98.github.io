<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in the College of Information Science & Electronic Engineering (ISEE) at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), Hangzhou, China, where I am jointly advised by Prof. [Zhiguo Shi](https://person.zju.edu.cn/shizg) (Vice dean of the College of ISEE), Prof. Quan Yu (Academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering), and Prof. Chengwei Zhou. From Oct. 2022 ~ Oct. 2023, I was a joint training Ph.D. student in the Department of Acoustics & Signal Processing at [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en), Espoo, Finland, where I am supervised by Prof. [Sergiy Vorobyov](https://users.aalto.fi/~vorobys1/) (IEEE Fellow). 


My research interest includes array signal processing, tensor signal processing, and AI for signal processing. To overcome the challenge of large-scale high-dimensional array signal processing, I develop the theories of sub-Nyquist tensor processing, efficient tensor optimization, and resource-efficient tensorized neural networks. The proposed methods facilitate direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation, adaptive beamforming, and channel estimation with low system costs and competitive performance, laying foundations for wireless communication, target localization, and anti-interference.

I have published more than 20 papers at top journals and international conferences with google citations <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=s7AazQUAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>).
